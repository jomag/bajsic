# Bajsic

Bajsic is a very, ehm, basic implementation of a BASIC interpreter, somewhat
compatible with DEC BASIC with the goal of being able to play the old, Swedish
text adventure _Stugan_.

The name Bajsic is a wordplay with BASIC and JS (JavaScript). Nothing else.

## Q & A

### What is the current status?

There's code. It does stuff. But it does not interpret Basic (yet).

### Why not TypeScript?

Cause then then name would not make sense.
